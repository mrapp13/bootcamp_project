# Coinbase - Case Study
## Increasing economic freedom in the world!

## Company Overview
Coinbase power the cryptoeconomy, with the main mission of bringing economic freedom to the world. This is done through creating a more fair, accessible and transparent financial system that is powered through crypto. Coinbase went public on the NASDAQ (the first crypto company to go public) in April 2021 at a valuation of nearly $100 billion. Before going public Coinbase received $540 million worth of VC funding, with initial startup funding by Y Combinator startup incubator contributing $150,000 in cash.
  - Founded in 2011 by Brian Armstrong who at the time was a lead engineer for ABNB and the addition of co-founder Fred Ersham a trader from Goldman Sachs in 2012.
  - While best known as a crypto trading platform the companies bigger vision is to create an "open financial system".  And to accomplish that goal: Coinbase will execute on a three-pronged strategy that positions and promotes crypto assets as an investment vehicle, a new financial system, and an app platform.
  - Before going public Coinbase received $540 million worth of VC funding.
    - Coinbase brings in revenue mainly via trading fees from traders, but also through subscription and services fees, and through the occasional sale of crypto assets that it owns.
  - Brian Armstrong started coinbase as a way to create a new economy that could tie the world together, free of banks, and the hassle of cross border transactions.  To be able to link the wealthy to the poor seamlessly and give everyone in the world opportunity.
## Business Activites
Coinbase is attempting to solve the issue of making cryptocurrencies and digital assets accessible to everyone, and through a platform that is easy to use and understand.
Coinbase has a large target audience that is global as the app is available in over 100 countries, and provides a large variety of tools and technologies.
- The retail trader has 2 very useful options available to them via the main coinbase page and the coin pro which is a strict trading app with lower fees.
   - The regular coinbase app is full of information and knowledge for new investors where you are given pages of information and then through answering quiz questions you have the opportunity to earn crypto. This is generally where the average retail trader makes their purchases due to its ease of use, and ability to buy crypto through different avenues, such as bank transfer, creit card, crypto conversions. The slightly more advanced trader and small institution will use Coin Pro which is the GDAX (Global Digital Asset Exchange) where fees are much lower but trading is slightly more complex.  The GDAX however is where Coinbase gets its liquidity which means it is in house which gives Coinbase an extra layer of protection from hackers, that other exchanges don't have, as Coinbase is the exception in that they act as both a brokerage and a book exchange.
  - The you have the coinbase wallet which gives investors access to DeFi applications, and the ability to hold your coins off exchange.  This wallet however is a hot wallet meaning the coins are kept online so it could be susceptible to hackers but it gives users a way to invest in things such as NFT's by connecting their wallets to a website such as Opensea. Alongside the coinbase wallet Coinbase does offer users the ability to use hosted wallets, which will allow users the ability to keep their coins in cold storage safe from hackers and only accessible via your seed phrase.
  - Next up in coinbases plethora of offerings is Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Commerce. The former enables institutional investors to buy, store, and trade crypto assets on a massive scale while the latter allows businesses to use the Coinbase Commerce platform to accept crypto as payment.
  - Coinbase also offers products for developers such as connect, Coinbase Pros trading API, and their acquisition of Bison Trails which allows developers to participate in multiple blockchains, build apps, and run nodes.
  - The last offering is the Coinbase debit card which is really tailored toward the average retail investor as a way to DCA in to their favorite crpyo's just by purahsing their every day items, or subscription services. Users can get up to 4% crypto back on what is a pre loaded debit card and DCA in to the markets simply by making purchases they were already making. 
 
 Given all of this information I have concluded that the target audience is global, reaches both the retail investor of the tiniest portfolio to large institutions looking to move millions of dollars. Recently it was noted that only about 3.9% of global population currently invests in crypto's.  Crypto has become the fastest growing market over the last decade and to still be at under 4% global adoption means there is still a large untapped market potential for Coinbase.  Global GDP is $84.7 trillion meaning is plenty of room to grow and expand for an app that is already teh argest in the united States and in over 100 countries already.  Coinbase has the advantage of being the simplest and most user freindly exchange making it very inviting for new users while also implementing more advanced trading features for the experienced investors.  It has also has high security paired with high liquidity which is key for giving their customers the best price possible on their coins.
## Landscape
When looking at Coinbase as a whole Brian Armstrong does not like to look at the company as just a tech company or jsut a financial secotr compayn.  He finds those designations to be limiting to what the company is accomplishing, he considers Cionbase to be a Crypto company, something new entirely.  A quote from the man himsel We’re not satisfied with the limitations of either technology or finance industries. "We don’t want to move fast and break things — that doesn’t work when you’re handling people’s money. We also don’t want to become so conservative that more risk-tolerant organizations outrun us. We do want to draw the very best talent from tech and finance, and any other industry where the smartest people on earth are to be found, and shape them to be innovative in this new industry. There are not clearly defined rules in this industry, which means we have an opportunity to help write them. That is a huge opportunity that requires creative problem solving" If i had to pick one domaine from the financial sector to place Coinbase in I would say banking as Coinbase does act as a way to get loans, store your crypto,
