# Coinbase - Case Study
## Increasing economic freedom in the world!

## Company Overview
Coinbase power the cryptoeconomy, with the main mission of bringing economic freedom to the world. This is done through creating a more fair, accessible and transparent financial system that is powered through crypto. Coinbase went public on the NASDAQ (the first crypto company to go public) in April 2021 at a valuation of nearly $100 billion. Before going public Coinbase received $540 million worth of VC funding, with initial startup funding by Y Combinator startup incubator contributing $150,000 in cash.
  - Founded in 2011 by Brian Armstrong who at the time was a lead engineer for ABNB and the addition of co-founder Fred Ersham a trader from Goldman Sachs in 2012.
  - While best known as a crypto trading platform the companies bigger vision is to create an "open financial system".  And to accomplish that goal: Coinbase will execute on a three-pronged strategy that positions and promotes crypto assets as an investment vehicle, a new financial system, and an app platform.
  - Before going public Coinbase received $540 million worth of VC funding
    - Coinbase brings in revenue mainly via trading fees from traders, but also through subscription and services fees, and through the occasional sale of crypto assets that it owns.
  - Brian Armstrong started coinbase as a way to create a new economy that could tie the world together, free of banks, and the hassle of cross border transactions.  To be able to link the wealthy to the poor seamlessly and give everyone in the world opportunity.
## Business Activites
Coinbase is attempting to solve the issue of making cryptocurrencies and digital assets accessible to everyone, and through a platform that is easy to use and understand.
Coinbase has a large target audience that is global as the app is available in over 100 countries.
- The retail trader has 2 very useful options available to them via the main coinbase page and the coin pro which is a strict trading app with lower fees.
   - The regular coinbase app is full of information and knowledge for new investors where you are given pages of information and then through answering quiz questions you have the opportunity to earn crypto. This is generally where the average retail trader makes their purchases due to its ease of use, and ability to buy crypto through different avenues, such as bank transfer, creit card, crypto conversions. The slightly more advanced trader and small institution will use Coin Pro which is the GDAX (Global Digital Asset Exchange) where fees are much lower but trading is slightly more complex.  The GDAX however is where Coinbase gets its liquidity which means it is in house which gives Coinbase an extra layer of protection from hackers, that other exchanges don't have as Coinbase is the exception in that they act as both a brokerage and a book exchange.
